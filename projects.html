      <h2>Pong (Java)</h2>
      <p>Pong is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by players for decades. It is a simple game that involves two paddles on either side of the screen, a ball, and a scoreboard. Players use the paddles to bounce the ball back and forth, trying to score a goal by getting the ball past the other player's paddle. The first player to score 10 goals wins the game. Pong is a fast-paced and addictive game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. It is a great game for players of all ages and skill levels, and it has stood the test of time as a beloved classic.</p>
